# Welcome to React Evernote
This notes application allows a user to keep track of things that they want to remember and makes these notes easily accessible to find again through the search by title feature, and the sorting features. 

## Project Requirements
    - db.json file storing notes with title, body and id attributes
    - React app running on localhost:4000 & JSON server on localhost:3000
    - Fetch to separate routes (GET '/notes', POST '/notes', PATCH 'notes/:id)

## User Statements
  - Deliverables:
    - As a user I can create a note
    - As a user I can see my notes in the side bar
    - As a user I can edit a note (and save or cancel my edits)
    - As a user I can filter through all my notes by title in the search bar
  - Stretch:
    - As a user I can sort my notes alphabetically, by date created, by date edited
    - As a user I can delete a note
